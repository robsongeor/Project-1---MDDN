        <h3>Internet Service Providers</h3>
        <p>An Internet service provider is an organisation that provides services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet. This is who you pay to access the internet. They buy access to the network of cables that run to your street and then to your house that is owned and operated by chorus. This cable network runs through out the country.

        <h3>Chrous</h3>
        <p>Under the roads and streets of New Zealand lie large networks of copper and fibre cables. This network of cables is run by chorus, who sell the use of these cables to the Internet service providers. These cables run back to the exchanges.</p>

        <h3>Modem</h3>
        <p>A modem is a device that converts data sent through the chorus network from your Internet service provider into a digital signal ready for devices to receive. This device is what allows you to connect to the internet. </p>

        <h3>Router</h3>
        <p>A Router takes the digital signal from the modem to allow communication between devices and the Internet. The router has antenna that can encode and send data, and decode and receive data through radio waves. Though most home routers are wireless they do include wired ports that allow a physical connection through an ethernet cable.</p>

        <h3>Ethernet</h3>
        <p>Desktops and Older laptops sometimes don’t have the antennas to receive Wireless radio waves. These devices have to make use of a wired connection to send and receive data. The ethernet cable facilitates this transfer of data  </p>
